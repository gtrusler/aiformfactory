## Initial Project Review
When opening any project:
1. Check for /instructions directory, create if missing
2. Create and persist core documentation files:
   ```markdown
   persist /instructions/README.md with content:
   # Project Documentation Guide

   ## Initial Setup
   ### Prerequisites
   ```bash
   # 1. Ensure conda is activated with the correct environment
   conda activate PROJECT_NAME-env  # or your project-specific environment name

   # If environment doesn't exist:
   conda create -n PROJECT_NAME-env python=3.11
   conda activate PROJECT_NAME-env
   ```

   ## Solutions
   ## Patterns
   ## Performance Insights
   ## Tools and Libraries

   persist /instructions/ARCHITECTURE.md with content:
   # System Architecture
   ## System Design
   ## Data Flow
   ## Components
   ## Deployment
   ## Schema

   persist /instructions/CONTRIBUTING.md with content:
   # Contributing Guide
   ## Development Setup
   ## Coding Standards
   ## Review Process
   ## Tools and Requirements
   ## Environment Setup
   ```
3. Acknowledge completion: "I've reviewed/created the instruction documents in /instructions"
4. If using venv, recommend migration to conda

## Environment Management

### Conda Setup
- If project uses venv, convert to conda:
  1. Export venv requirements
  2. Create conda environment with project name
  3. Install packages (conda first, then pip)
  4. Update documentation
  5. Remove old venv
  ```markdown
  persist /instructions/ENVIRONMENT.md with content:
  # Environment Setup
  ## Conda Environment
  ## Package List
  ## Installation Steps
  ## Migration Notes
  ```

### Conda Best Practices
- Never install in base environment
- Create isolated project environments
- Use PROJECT_NAME-env naming convention
- Install packages in single command
- Use conda-forge channel when possible
- Install heavy dependencies via conda first
- Export with --no-builds flag

## Code Style and Structure
- Keep functions under 15 lines when possible
- Use functional programming patterns in JavaScript
- Avoid classes unless necessary
- Separate business logic from UI
- Create reusable components and helpers
- Structure by feature/domain rather than type
```markdown
persist /instructions/CODE_STYLE.md with content:
# Code Style Guide
## Function Guidelines
## Programming Patterns
## Project Structure
## Component Guidelines
```

## Naming Conventions
- Directories: kebab-case (user-authentication)
- Variables/functions: camelCase (getUserData)
- React Components: PascalCase (UserProfile.js)
- Python files: snake_case (data_processing.py)

## Documentation Updates
### When to Update Each File:

#### PROJECT.md
- Features or functionality change
- URLs or resources change

- Team changes
```markdown
persist each change to /instructions/PROJECT.md under appropriate sections
```

#### CHANGELOG.md
- New feature
- Breaking change
- Bug fix
- Security update
- Dependency update
```markdown
persist each change to /instructions/CHANGELOG.md under [Unreleased] section

- Bug solutions
- Performance improvements
- Useful tools/libraries
```markdown
persist each learning to /instructions/LEARNINGS.md under appropriate section
```

#### ARCHITECTURE.md

- Component additions
- Deployment changes
- Schema updates
```markdown
persist each architecture change to /instructions/ARCHITECTURE.md under appropriate section

```

## Best Practices
- Handle errors gracefully
- Comment only complex business logic
- Cache expensive operations
- Consider mobile and accessibility
- Review dependencies regularly
- Clean unused conda packages/caches
- Document environment variables
- Keep environment.yml updated
```markdown
persist /instructions/BEST_PRACTICES.md with content:
# Best Practices
## Error Handling
## Code Comments
## Caching Strategy
## Accessibility Guidelines
## Dependency Management
## Environment Variables
```

## Testing
- Test complex logic and critical flows
- Test error cases and edge conditions
- Mock external dependencies
```markdown
persist /instructions/TESTING.md with content:
# Testing Guidelines
## Test Coverage Requirements
## Testing Patterns
## Mock Guidelines
```

## Focus Priorities
- Readability over cleverness
- Simplicity over premature optimization
- Maintainability over perfect abstractions
- Pragmatic solutions over theoretical purity
```markdown
persist /instructions/PRINCIPLES.md with content:
# Development Principles
## Code Quality Priorities
## Optimization Guidelines
## Architectural Principles
```
