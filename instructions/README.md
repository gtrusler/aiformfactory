## Documentation Workflow

### 1. Starting Work

   ```bash
   if [ ! -d "instructions" ]; then
     mkdir instructions
     # Initialize documentation files
     touch instructions/README.md
     touch instructions/PROJECT.md
     touch instructions/CHANGELOG.md
     touch instructions/LEARNINGS.md
     touch instructions/ARCHITECTURE.md
     touch instructions/CONTRIBUTING.md
   fi
   ```
2. Check for required documentation files
   ```bash
   for file in README.md PROJECT.md CHANGELOG.md LEARNINGS.md ARCHITECTURE.md CONTRIBUTING.md; do
     if [ ! -f "instructions/$file" ]; then
       echo "Creating missing file: $file"
       # Use templates from this guide to create file
     fi
   done
   ```
3. Review or initialize documentation
4. Pull latest changes
5. Review current status

### 2. During Development
1. Update CHANGELOG.md for significant changes
2. Document solutions in LEARNINGS.md
3. Update ARCHITECTURE.md for design changes
4. Keep current status updated in LEARNINGS.md

### 3. Before Ending Work
1. Update current status in LEARNINGS.md
2. Add any new changes to CHANGELOG.md
3. Review and update other docs as needed
4. Commit documentation updates

## Best Practices
1. **Keep It Current**
   - Update docs as you go
   - Don't wait until the end
   - Document decisions while fresh

2. **Be Specific**
   - Include dates
   - Name specific tools/versions
   - Link to relevant resources
   - List exact steps

3. **Think of Others**
   - Write for future team members
   - Explain the "why"
   - Include examples
   - Link between docs

4. **Format Consistently**
   - Use markdown formatting
   - Keep sections organized
   - Use clear headings
   - Include code blocks

## Documentation vs Git
- Git tracks code changes
- Documentation explains:
  - Current status
  - Design decisions
  - Known issues
  - Future plans
  - Setup instructions

## Updating Documentation
1. **Be Concise**
   - Keep updates focused
   - Remove outdated info
   - Use bullet points
   - Link don't repeat

2. **Include Context**
   - Add dates to updates
   - Reference ticket numbers
   - Link to related docs
   - Explain impact

3. **Review Regularly**
   - Start of work
   - During development
   - Before commits
   - End of work
